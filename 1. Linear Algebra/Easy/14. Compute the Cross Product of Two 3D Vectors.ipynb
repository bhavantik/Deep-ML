    "\n",
    "- Implement a function to compute the cross product of two 3-dimensional vectors. The cross product of two vectors results in a third vector that is perpendicular to both and follows the right-hand rule. This concept is fundamental in physics, engineering, and 3D graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ§® Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "cross_product([1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0])\n",

    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0, 0, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning:**\n",
    "- The cross product of two orthogonal unit vectors [1, 0, 0] and [0, 1, 0] is [0, 0, 1], pointing in the positive z-direction as per the right-hand rule."

    "### What is Right hand rule?\n",
    "\n",
    "The right-hand rule is a convention used to determine the direction of the resulting vector from the cross product of two vectors in three-dimensional space. This rule is commonly used in physics and engineering to find the orientation of vectors, particularly in contexts involving rotational forces, magnetic fields, and angular momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Right-Hand Rule Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Orientation**: Start by orienting your right hand such that your fingers point in the direction of the first vector (\\(\\mathbf{a}\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rotation**: Rotate your fingers towards the direction of the second vector (\\(\\mathbf{b}\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Thumb Direction**: Your thumb, when extended, will point in the direction of the cross product vector (\\(\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imagine \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) as two arrows in space.\n",
    "- Position your right hand so that it follows the first arrow (\\(\\mathbf{a}\\)).\n",
    "- Rotate your fingers towards the second arrow (\\(\\mathbf{b}\\)).\n",
    "- Your thumb will naturally extend perpendicular to both \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), indicating the direction of the cross product vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Magnetic Fields**: In electromagnetism, the right-hand rule helps determine the direction of the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Torque and Angular Momentum**: When calculating torque or angular momentum, the right-hand rule helps determine the direction of rotation or spin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **3D Graphics and Robotics**: Used to determine normals or orientations in 3D space, crucial for rendering and movement calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The right-hand rule is an intuitive way to visualize vector interactions in three dimensions and is essential for understanding how vector directions relate in physics and engineering contexts."
